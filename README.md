DEF CON SAFE MODE
=================

AKA DEF CON 2020
----------------

AKA DEF CON 28
--------------

I'll save all my DEF CON 2020 stuff here.
Likely some notes
Definitely some files
Probably some code. If there is code it will likely take input from a `downloads/` directory. I'm not going to check that in, because it is kind of big and freely available.
